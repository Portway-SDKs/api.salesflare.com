#Salesflare API

## Introduction  ## Getting Started  The Salesflare API allows you to access and build your own applications or integrations that interact with Salesflare.  The Salesflare API provides a RESTful interface with JSON-formatted responses to access most Salesflare resources.  ## Authentication  The Salesflare API uses bearer token based authentication, which means you need to use the key-value pair \"Authorization : Bearer APIKEY\" in the header to authenticate.  You can make an API key in [\"Settings\" > \"API keys\"](https://app.salesflare.com/#/settings/apikeys).  Click on the large orange \"+\" button on the bottom right of the screen to create an API key.  ![Screenshot API Key Settings](https://lib.salesflare.com/api_docs/screenshot_settings_apikeys.png)  ## Requests  All requests must be sent using HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher. Please make sure your developer tools support this version of TLS as older versions or SSL are not supported for security reasons.  For PUT or POST requests (e.g. create, update), the payload must be provided as JSON in the request body.  ## Responses  Responses use HTTP status codes, with the most typical ones being:  | Code                   | Meaning               | |------------------------|-----------------------| | Successful Responses                           | | 200                    | OK                    | | Error Responses                                | | 400                    | Bad Request           | | 401                    | Unauthorized          | | 404                    | Not Found             | | 429                    | Too Many Requests     | | 500                    | Internal Server Error |  ## Testing  We recommend testing our API with Postman.  ### Download specification  Our API is documented following the OpenAPI specification. You can download it [here](https://api.salesflare.com/openapi.json)  ### Import in Postman  To import the collection, open Postman and click Import, then select \"Import From Link\"  Copy & Paste the following link and press the \"Import\" button:  > https://api.salesflare.com/openapi.json  ![Screenshot Postman Import](https://lib.salesflare.com/api_docs/screenshot_postman_import.png)  ## Support  For API questions and support, please email support@salesflare.com or click the chat bubble below.

# load the gem
require 'openapi_client'

# The following  was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
# The generated `.rspec` file contains `--require spec_helper` which will cause
# this file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any
# files.
#
# Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as
# light-weight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file
# will add to the boot time of your test suite on EVERY test run, even for an
# individual file that may not need all of that loaded. Instead, consider making
# a separate helper file that requires the additional dependencies and performs
# the additional setup, and require it from the spec files that actually need
# it.
#
# The `.rspec` file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that
# users commonly want.
#
# See http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration

  # rspec-expectations config goes here. You can use an alternate
  # assertion/expectation library such as wrong or the stdlib/minitest
  # assertions if you prefer.
  config.expect_with :rspec do |expectations|
    # This option will default to `true` in RSpec 4. It makes the `description`
    # and `failure_message` of custom matchers include text for helper methods
    # defined using `chain`, e.g.:
    #     be_bigger_than(2).and_smaller_than(4).description
    #     # => "be bigger than 2 and smaller than 4"
    # ...rather than:
    #     # => "be bigger than 2"
    expectations.include_chain_clauses_in_custom_matcher_descriptions = true
  end

  # rspec-mocks config goes here. You can use an alternate test double
  # library (such as bogus or mocha) by changing the `mock_with` option here.
  config.mock_with :rspec do |mocks|
    # Prevents you from mocking or stubbing a method that does not exist on
    # a real object. This is generally recommended, and will default to
    # `true` in RSpec 4.

# with RSpec, but feel free to customize to your heart's content.

  # to individual examples or groups you care about by tagging them with
  # `:focus` metadata. When nothing is tagged with `:focus`, all examples
  # get run.

  config.run_all_when_everything_filtered = true

  # you configure your source control system to ignore this file.

  # be too noisy due to issues in dependencies.

  # file, and it's useful to allow more verbose output when running an
  # individual spec file.

  # end of the spec run, to help surface which specs are running
  # particularly slow.

  # order dependency and want to debug it, you can fix the order by providing
  # the seed, which is printed after each run.

  config.order = :random

  # Seed global randomization in this process using the `--seed` CLI option.

  # test failures related to randomization by passing the same `--seed` value
  # as the one that triggered the failure.
